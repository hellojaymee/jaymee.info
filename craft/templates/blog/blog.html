        <p>I began working at a web development company  nearly 3 years ago today. My first postion with was in the Sales department working as "wrangler". This meant that I cold called prospects and "probed" them with open-ended quesitons on how they interacted with their website. They'd either answer my questions or hang up immediately. If they didn't hang up, I'd listen to them patiently and purposefully, just like I was trained to do. I'd make note of all the negative things they'd say about their site, and when it was my turn to speak I'd make sure to repeat those things back to them but only if I could explain why <em>our websites</em> didn't have this problem. Most of the reason our sites didn't have these problems was becasue we "built our own Content management system with your industry in mind" and it was "so easy to use!". I knew I needed to say buzz words like "Drag and drop" and "wyzywig", but beyond that simplistic, high-level description of our CMS, I had no clue what it did or how it worked. I had at least interacted with a CMS at the job had before this one - which was being a Sales Manager for a Holiday Inn - When something to do with the hotel changed I would update that information in the CMS! So, I was totally an expert in them and I felt confident that I knew how to sell them. I think that confidence got me the job at the web development company.</p>
        <p>I wanted this Sales job at a web development company because in a few months I'd be going back to college to learn how to become a web developer and I wanted to have a shoe-in for a developer job in the company when I felt I was ready for one. And, uh - thats <em>exactly</em> what happened. I began taking classes at a local community college with a focus on programming and web development. For a little over a year I spent my days making cold calls and my nights learning java, javascript, html and css. I <em>loved</em> it. I loved the challenge of the backend - the high of solving a puzzle that had you stumped for a hours, but I was surpised to find out how much more I enjoyed working on the front-end of things and playing a part in the design of things. The instant gradification of watching what you code come to beautiful life was so much fun, so that's where I threw my focus. The program at the community college was primarily focused in back-end work and the front-end that it touched on was pretty dated, so I started to seek out other resources, like the internet, for example. I found out about codeschool, codeacademy, and treehouse. I followed tons of designerss and Front-end developers on twitter, and I reached out to friends who I kenw were involved in the local tech community. And from there I just absorbed it all. I learned and learned and learned until I felt that I finally understood enough to at least be not <em>unvaluable</em> as a web developer somewhere. I had built all of these static, brochure websites and I was ready to rock.</p>
        <p>The next time I saw a job opening for a front-end position at my company I grabbed all the courage I could muster and I applied for it! And I did not get it! Most of my coworkers were a bit surprised to find out I was interested in the job and I got a lot of, "Thats a pretty big jump from sales!" comments. But I already knew that! I felt discouraged, but I also felt glad that I went for it and glad that everyone around the office now knew that it was something I was interested in and that working as a sales associate may or may not have crushing my introverted soul.</p>
        <p>I kept on making the cold calls and I kept on learning and trying new things and when a job became available again, I applied again. This time I got it. The day the job was offered to me was one of the best days of my life. Not only did I land a great job that day, I also learned that you <em>can</em> actually do anything you want. You don't don't have to stay in a position that you just sort of landind in and it's all you know. Even though I had spent so much energy and time working toward this career switch, and certainly hoped one day I'd land a job, I'm not sure I actually beleived it would ever happen. I was floating. I began working on tiny projects in order to get to know our CMS. I would load content for clients (sometimes 40+ hours of loading) and see what it was like for them and what kind of content types and components we had to work with. I then moved on to doing "color customizations", which means I would go into a site using one of our theme designs that already been created by another developer and swap out the default design colors to match a clients logo and branding. This task that puts me to sleep now but at the time I was on cloud nine. Unfortunatly or fortunatly, the team that worked in this department when I joined experienced mass turnover almost as soon as I got there (no, it was not my fault!), so fortunatly or unfortunatly I was forced to take on larger projects with little to no training after just a month or so of working there. For me, though, this was great. I didn't want to spend my time doing grunt work I wanted to code. The first things I got to make were custom portals or custom layouts. These were simple, single layouts but I had most of the design control and all of the coding control. This was the first time I found mysefl on the opposite side of a CMS. Oh, so you don't just hardcdoe websites? Oh, so I can't just drag and drop this design I've built into this CMS? No. First, I needed to consider which parts of my layouts would be managed by the client and therefore needed to be dynamic and how to logically put it together in the most efficitnet way. Then, I needed to learn a little PHP and after that I had to learn a little twig. In the beginning, integrating my layouts into our CMS was the most confusing and foreign part of my job, but after a little time, it became the simplist. After custom portals and layouts I started building landing page designs that were coming from our Creative department so I got to interact with our web designers for the first time. After a few of those I started making actual custom designs for clients. This was when I felt like I'd made it. This is it. This is what I was aiming for and this is what I want to do forever. To take a PSD from a designer and make it "real" was the most fun job I could ever have. I got to build a pretty design from scratch, send it off, and start all over on another pretty design. I did that for nearly another year until our department was finally standing on it's own again and we were able to start building theme templates again. Myself and oen other developer on the team were the lucky folks who got to work on those. Switching my mindset from building highly customized designs for a specific client who told us exactly what they want into a generic and robust site that would need to be functional enough to accomodate 100 different clients with 100 different site structures and content packages was a very fun challenge. No longer was I measuring out each pixel in a PSD and making a perfectly matched mockup. I had to consider the nearly endless number of things a client could do in each space of a design and build out a design that not only wouldn't break in any of those situitaions but would actually look good doing it. It mixed the pretty, fun parts of front-end coding with a little bit of the logical planning that comes with back-end coding. This is what I'm currently doing now - building the very themes that I used to try to sell.  </p>
